My project will be a top-down scrolling shooter.  The goal will be to shoot and destroy all
the enemies before they shoot you.  The enemies will be in a grid at the top of the screen
and will be moving in a predefined way so that shooting them is not completely simple.
They will fire bullets toward the bottom of the screen in random intervals.  The enemy
spaceships will probably each have a certain amount of health, so that it takes more than a
single bullet to destroy them.  Similarly, the user's spaceship will have a health bar
which is visible to the user, and when that health bar decreases to zero, the user will
lose.

In a second level, ships will not just move around at the top of the screen, but will, in
random intervals, fly down to the bottom of the screen in the general direction of the
user's ship to get a better shot.
